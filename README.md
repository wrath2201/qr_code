# qr_code
A Node.js CLI tool that generates a QR code image from a user-provided URL and saves it as qr_image.png. The URL is also saved in URL.txt. Uses Inquirer for URL input, qr-image for QR code creation, and Node's fs module for file handling. Run with node index.js to generate QR codes easily.
